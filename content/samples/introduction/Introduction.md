# Samples

Samples are of two different forms, gamelets and snippets. 

## Gamelets

These are not full games but small projects that put together several aspects of BabylonJS in one place with a description of their design and construction. Some could be developed into full games but really they are just give ideas which expand on the examples in the documentation.

## Snippets

These are Javascript functions that can be added to your BabylonJS project if they are useful. Each is given a brief explanation and a Playground example of its use.
