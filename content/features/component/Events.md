# Event Handling

There are two features of Babylon.js that handle events, actions and observables. It is also possible to use plain Javascript.

Using [actions](/How_To/How_to_use_Actions) events are managed with the _actionManager_ along with triggers such as _onPickTrigger_ to determine if a mesh is clicked or touched or _onKeyDown_ to determine if a key is pressed during a scene.

[Observables](/How_To/Observables) are the latest addition to Babylon.js and their aim is to make event handling within Babylon.js more consistent and coherent for developers of Babylon.js. A particular use is with the [Babylon.GUI](/How_To/Gui)
