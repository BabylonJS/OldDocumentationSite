# Graphical User Interface

There are a number of options for adding a GUI to Babylon.js. 

The GUI that allows you to place buttons and labels in 3D space is the extension [BABYLON.GUI](/how-to/gui/gui)  which can also be used as a 2D front of screen GUI. It is integrated into the playground.

An alternative 2D GUI is the extension [CastorGUI](/extensions/castor-gui/castor-gui) which has extensive buttons and you can see an external example [here](http://www.babylon.actifgames.com/demoCastorGUI/). 

Also in the playgrounds you will come across dat.GUI, an external interface but it is integrated within the Playground.
