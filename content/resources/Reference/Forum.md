The [Babylon.js forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com) is a fantastic place to get help or help others.
This short page is intended to help you get the best answer as quickly as possible.

## What to do if you have a question for the forum

The best way to get an answer quickly is to follow this 3 easy steps:
- Search about your issue on the [documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com). Maybe the problem you have is just a matter of understanding how the API works?
- Search about your issue on the [forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com). Maybe someone else already had the same problem?
- Provide a reproduction of your issue within the [playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com). Questions with a playground are likely to get a answer within the next two hours. It is really hard for the community to help without a repro because of the inner rich nature of JavaScript, WebGL and Babylon.js. Consider this step **mandatory**.
