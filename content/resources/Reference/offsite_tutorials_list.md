# Babylon.js Off-Site Tutorials and Documents

## Introduction

Hello, welcome to Babylon.js  - a webGL game developer's framework. Throughout the history of Babylon.js, coders and authors have written How_To and documentation which is stored in places other than at our primary documentation site.  In *this* document, we will attempt to provide links-to and information-about those off-site documents.

|______________Title______________ | Keywords | Description |
| :--- | :---: | --- |
| [ **Using VertexData/VertexBuffer** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/trees/trees.html) | VertexData, VertexBuffer, Indices, Vertices, Normals | [Julian "Temechon" Chenard](http://www.pixelcodr.com/aboutme.html) is a fine game programmer, teacher, OOP-master, and a darned nice guy, too.  In this splendid tutorial, Temechon uses the handy Babylon VertexData object, along with blank/updatable mesh... to make lightweight trees.|
| [ **Contributing to Babylon.js** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/contribute/contribute.html) | Contribute, GitHub | People who are not familiar with source repositories, GitHub, version control, etc... sometimes struggle-with approved methods for open-source contributions. Temechon succeeds in removing those struggles... with this comprehensive tutorial about contributing to Babylon.js. |
| [ **Toad Attack - The Making-Of** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/toad_attack/toad_attack.html) | Game | Here is a fantastic two-part "Basics" tutorial about the making of "Toad Attack", one of Temechon's cool games.  Good stuff! |
| [ **All About ActionManagers** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/plane/plane.html) | ActionManager, Actions, Trigger, Predicate | Once upon a time, Deltakosh created an ActionManager class with [great docs](/How_To/how_to_use_actions). In this cool tutorial, Temechon uses it within a complete webGL game. Two How_To in one! |
| [ **Old School Oimo Physics** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/oimo/oimo.html) | Physics, Oimo, Impostor | Temechon coded much of the original physics "plugins", interfacing third-party physics engines... to Babylon.js. Later, version 2 of the plugins was developed by Raanan Weber (see below), but Raanan ensured that v2 plugins were backwards-compatible with original v1 plugins. So, this older Oimo-based physics tutorial is still quite pertinent. Its code examples still work great. |
| [ **More Oimo - Impulses & Velocities** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/physics/physics.html) | Physics, Oimo, AngularVelocity, LinearVelocity, ApplyImpulse | In this slightly-advanced Oimo physics tutorial, Temechon shows us how to "force the issue"... adding energy and direction to Oimo's physics impostors. This tutorial is based-upon the v1 Oimo plugin, but again, due to backwards-compatibility, all code examples work fine with the v2 plugins, as well.  It's all good! |
| [ **First Person Shooter Prototype** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/shooter/shooter.html) | OOP, Project, Asset, LayerMask, Viewport, PointerLock | The first-person shooter (FPS) game is one of the most enjoyable and popular game-types in 3D land.  In this gorgeous tutorial, Julian takes us end-to-end through the development process.  As with all of Julian's games and How_To, he uses Object Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques, which result in re-usable pieces. These OOP pieces streamline work-flow for future games/projects.  |
| [ **Temechon's Projects Page** ](http://www.pixelcodr.com/projects.html) | Projects | This is not a link to a tutorial, but instead, a link to Temechon's "Projects" web page.  As you can see, Temechon is a prolific game-author, both 2D and 3D.  And we know why he is able to produce game after game, quickly and easily, right?  Yep, OOP... reusable code... he does it well. Borrow his techniques, and you borrow great wisdom. |

This tutorial series has 3 primary *parts*, and an introduction.  This is that introduction... to this highly-important topic. |
| [ **Scene Optimization Part 1 - The Mesh** ](https://blog.raananweber.com/2015/09/03/scene-optimization-in-babylon-js/) | Optimization | High-poly-count mesh can bog-down a scene, and Inspector Raanan is on the case. This is part 1 of an unfinished 3-part tutorial series... where Raanan optimizes 3 major sub-sections of a Babylon.js scene (mesh, materials, effects). This is the part about mesh. |
| [ **Scene Optimization Part 2 - The Materials** ]() | Optimization | Coming soon!  |
| [ **Scene Optimization Part 3 - The Effects** ]() | Optimization | Coming soon! |
| [ **WebWorker-Based Collision Detection in Babylon.js** ](https://blog.raananweber.com/2015/05/26/collisions-using-workers-for-babylonjs/) | WebWorker, Worker, Collision, Messages | Web workers are a method to fork-off :x certain scene tasks... to separate OS threads.  Remember how I mentioned above... that Raanan likes to smooth rough roads?  Collision detection/servicing is one of those webGL rough roads caused by heavy loads.  In this 2-part series, Raanan meticulously analyses the situation, and applies worker threads to attempt improvements. A link to part 2 is provided near the bottom. |
| [ **Integrating Travis-CI and BabylonJS** ](https://blog.raananweber.com/2015/05/26/travis-ci-and-babylonjs/) | Travis, GitHub, Integration, NodeJS, NPM, Gulp, Grunt, TypeScript | This short tutorial is mostly for those who *build* Babylon.js from TypeScript source.  Travis has many features that assist during the build process, and Raanan shows us how to set it up properly. |
