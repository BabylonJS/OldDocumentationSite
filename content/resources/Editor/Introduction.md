# Introduction

![Introduction](/img/extensions/Editor/editor.png)

For a quick and complete introduction with videos, you can read this post : [https://medium.com/babylon-js/welcome-to-the-babylon-js-editor-c08dccdcec07#.e1lm87d4g](https://medium.com/babylon-js/welcome-to-the-babylon-js-editor-c08dccdcec07#.e1lm87d4g)

The Babylon.js Editor is the final stage for artists and developers in scene designs.
It provides several tools not provided (or supported by the exporters) by 3D modelers such as 3ds Max, Blender, etc.

As an example, the Babylon.js Materials Library, which is not supported by 3D modelers, can be managed in the Babylon.js Editor.

In other words, this editor is a Web Application providing several tools to help artists (and developers) to debug, animate,
configure and export Babylon.js scenes. In other words, this editor provides the optional final stage (in addition to the Babylon.js
exporters of 3ds Max, Blender, Unity3D, etc.) to designers before they release their final scenes.
