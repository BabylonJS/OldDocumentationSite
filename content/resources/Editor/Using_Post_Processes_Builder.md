# Using the Post-Processes Builder

## Creating post-processes

Tool provided for developers, you are able to develop custom post-processes, chained, using a JSON configuration.

Features available:
* Develop GLSL code directly in the Editor
* Manage custom defines
* Manage custom uniforms (float, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4)
* Manage custom samplers (from textures and post-processes)

## Using the editor to preview your post-processes

![PreviewPostProcessBuilder](/img/extensions/Editor/PostProcessBuilder/PreviewPostProcessBuilder.png)

To preview the post-process you just developed, you can click the button "**Apply Chain**" on the toolbar, or directly push **CTRL + B**.

Also, if you want to apply the chain on the current scene, just click the button "**Apply chain on scene**"

## Showing the shader errors

When the shader is unable to compile, you can use the output console to see what is happening.

## Reordering post-processes chain

You can reorder the post-processes chain using the list. Just drag'n'drop the items by clicking on the line number

## The sampler "originalSampler"

This sampler is automatically created by the Post-Process Builder Extension. It just contains the original color of the scene.

## Using the JSON configuration to customize uniforms and samplers

In the tab "**Configuration**", you can add custom uniforms and samplers. Here is the definition:

```
{
  "ratio": number, // The ratio of the post-process in ]0, 1]
  "defines":  string[], // Array of defines used when compiling the effect
  "samplers": { uniform: string, "source": string }[], // Array of samplers 
  "uniforms": { name: string, value: number | number[] }[] // Array of uniforms
}
```

When opening the Post-Process Builder tool, a JSON configuration is provided as example.

### Using uniform samplers

To define a new sampler just set its name in the GLSL code and its path.

Using a texture already loaded:
```
"samplers": [
    { uniform: "testSampler", "source": "myTexture.png" },
    ... etc.
]
```

Using a post-process you already created
```
"samplers": [
    { uniform: "testSampler", "source": "myPostProcessName" },
    ... etc.
]
```

### Using uniform values

To define a new uniform value just set its name in the GLSL code and its value.

Available value types are:
* number
* Vector2
* Vector3
* Vector4

Already set values:
* screenSize: represents the size of the post-process in pixels

Using a number:
```
"uniforms": [
    { name: "exposure", "value": 1.0 },
    ... etc.
]
```

Using a vector (2d, 3d and 4d)
```
"samplers": [
    { name: "size", "value": [0, 1] },
    ... etc.
]
```
