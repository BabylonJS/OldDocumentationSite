# Introduction

Introduced in the Editor v2.0.0 as a POC, the `Graph Editor` is now live starting from the Editor v3.2.0.
As all other tools available in the Editor, the `Graph Editor` is available over the main toolbar in `Tools -> Graph Editor`:
![OpeningGraphEditor](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/opening.png)

# Understanding the tool

As for the [Node Material Editor](https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/node_material#using-the-node-material-editor), the `Graph Editor` is used to create custom behaviors for elements in the scene without having to know how to code.
The `Graph Editor` tends to evoluate and provide features such as the [Unreal Engine Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/index.html)

The way to attach graphs to elements of the scene is the same as the [`Code Editor`](https://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/custom_scripts):
* Select an element in the scene
* Click `Add New Graph`
* Give it a name
* Add, edit and remove nodes from the graph

All graphs are standalone and can be attached to multiple elements in the scene by clicking `Add` in the list on the left side of the tool.

# Adding nodes by the example
Once a graph has been created and attached to an element of the scene, the goal is to add nodes and connect them to finally create a real algorithm.

Let's have a sphere and try the following example: on the user clicks on the sphere, we want to translate the sphere from x=0,y=0,z=0 to x=2,y=3,z=4.

First, let's add a node. By default, a graph is empty showing an empty canvas:
![EmptyGraphEditor](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/empty.png)

To add a new node, just right click on the canvas and a popup will appear to select a node to add. By default, the `search` input is focused and you can research a node by name. Let's search `"PointerDown"` and press `Enter` or double click the item in the list to add in the graph:
![GraphEditorSearchPointerDown](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/search_pointerdown.png)

The node is now in the graph and shows one output: a rectangle. All inputs/ouputs are identified by their form:
* Rectangle: means `executable`, can send/receive an event. These are called `"triggerable nodes"`.
* Circle: defines an input or output value. These are just receiving or outputing values.

From now, our `PointerDown` node is in the graph and is ready to trigger some nodes. It exists a large list of available nodes and here a particular one will be useful: the `Transform` node. This node will allow to modify the transforms (position, rotation and scale) the current node. Let's right click the graph and search for `"Transform"` and add the node:
![GraphAddedTransform](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/added_transform.png)

As we can see, the `Transform` node is `triggerable` as the first input is a rectangle. All other inputs/outputs are values as their forms are circle. All rectangles/circles on the left side are inputs and all rectangles/circles on the right side are outputs.

To connect nodes, let's drag'n'drop the `PointerDown` node output to the first input of the `Transform` node:
![GraphTransformConnected](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/transform_connected.png)

Once connected, the top color of the `Transform` node changed and became green. That means the execution time change:
* Grey color means "always executing"
* Green color means "executed on triggered"

In our case, the `Transform` node will be executed ONLY and ONLY when the user clicks on the sphere.

Back to the example, we want the sphere to have a new position x=2,y=3,y=4. That means the input "position" must receive a value to change the transform of the sphere. Let's add a new type of node called `"Type Nodes"`.
Type nodes are just nodes that define a type (number, string, vector, color, etc.). In our case, the position is a Vector 3D, so let's add a new Vector3 node:
![GraphVector3](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/vector3.png)

Once added, the output `"value"` (which is the vector reference itself) can be connected to the input `"position"` of the `Transform` node:
![GraphVector3Connected](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/vector3_connected.png)

Almost all nodes have options and can be customized. This is the case of the `Vector3` node, the values x, y, and z can be modified. So the output of the node can be customized. Let's click the `Vector3` node and go to the Editor's Edition Tools:
![GraphCustomizeVector3](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/customize_vector3.png)

The edition tool shows all the customizable properties. Here, the values x, y and z can be customized.

Finally, let's test our graph! To live test a graph, just click the button `Start/Stop` in the Graph Editor an then click the sphere.
The connection between the `PointerDown` and `Transform` nodes will be animated to show an activity: the `PointerDown` node triggered the output on the sphere has been clicked and the `Transform` node has be triggered to change the position of the sphere. That's all!

# Using variables
Each graph can have a list of variables. All variables are scoped and available ONLY and ONLY in the graph's context.
These are used to store values that support read/write. Variable can be read and written using the `Variable` and are identified by a name, like when writing code.

Variables support the following types:
* String
* Boolean
* Number
* Vector 2D
* Vector 3D
* Vector 4D

To add a variable, just click on the graph and the Editor's Edition Tools will be updated to display a list of available variables (empty by default):
![GraphEmptyVariables](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/empty_variables.png)

Let's modify the example and replace the `Vector3` node by a `Variable` node.
To add a variable, just click `Add New` in the variables list, then give it a name and a type. Here, `Vector 3D`:
![GraphAddVariable](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/add_variable.png)

Once added, the variable appears in the variables list and can be modified by clicking on the button `Edit`. Let's set the variables values to x=2,y=3,z=4:
![GraphModifyVariable](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/modify_variable.png)

The variable is now available to use and is configured. Just add the variable to the graph: right click the canvas and add a new node of type `Variable`.
Once added, a combo box is available on the node and can be customized to select the wanted variable: just select your variable:
![GraphAddVariableNode](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/add_variable_node.png)

From now, what we have to do is to remove the constant Vector 3D previously added and replace by our variable:
![GraphVariableFinal](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/variable_final.png)

# Advanced behavior example
Let's take this graph as example to illustrate a more advanced behavior. The goal is to rotate the sphere on the Y axis on the pointer is over the sphere.
Then, once the pointer is out, restore the rotation on the Y axis to 0:
![GraphAdvancedGraph](/img/extensions/Editor/GraphEditor/advanced_graph.png)

Teaching logic can't be done here. So, let's experiment with all other available nodes and create awesome graphs for awesome behaviors in your scene.
