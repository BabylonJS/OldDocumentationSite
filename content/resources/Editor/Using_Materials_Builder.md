# Using the Materials Builder

## Opening the Materials Builder

As for the Post-Processes Builder, you are able to develop custom materials using a JSON configuration.
Just select it in the main tool bar.

Features available:
* Develop GLSL code directly in the Editor (vertex and pixel)
* Manage custom uniforms (float, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4)
* Manage custom samplers (textures)

## Adding a new material

Before opening the Materials Builder, you can add a new material or select an existing one in order to edit it.
To add a new material, just click "**Add New**: then, a new material with default vertex, pixel and configuration files is created.

To edit a material, just select one and click the button "**Select**"

## Using the Materials Builder

Once opened, you are now able to configure the uniforms & samplers, and edit the vertex & pixel shaders code.

On the left, you have an edition tool which allows you to configure the material:
* The material's name
* Build the material

And the preview scene:
* Enable / disable shadows
* Enable / disable lights (to test if all light types are supported by your shader)

## The configuration

The configuration tab allows you to declare custom uniforms and samplers.
In the default material all available options, like "**time**", are used as example (here, time is used by waves function in default vertex shader).

For samplers, the parameter "**uniformName**" is important: the name is used to declare the texture matrix and texture infos in the vertex shader.

## The vertex shader

The vertex and pixel shaders follow the way to create materials with Babylon.js. A lot of code is already written then you only have to include files (**#include**).
All default "includes" are already implemented in default material.
In the default material, a custom waves function is available as an example line 64

On line 26, the uniforms related to the sampler named "**myTexture**" (in samplers configuration) are available as example.
The uniforms "**myTextureMatrix**" and "**vMyTextureInfos**" are sent automatically by the engine following the name you set in configuration: here "**myTexture**".

Free to you to use it in your vertex shader :)

## The pixel shader

As for vertex shader, the uniforms "**vMyTextureInfos**" and "**myTextureSampler**" are set automatically by the engine.
Free to you to use it in the pixel shader

## Building the material

In order to preview the material in the preview scene, just click the button "**Build Material**" in the edition tool (on the left).
Then, the material is applied on the mesh you specified in the edition tool (default "**Box**").

Once built, new fields are created in edition tool:
* Uniforms
* Samplers

These fields are used to realtime customize your material in order to get your configuration perfect.

## Applying your new material on a mesh

Once built, you can apply your material in the main scene of your project. Then, apply the material on one/multiple meshes.
Just click "**Apply on scene**".

![ApplyOnScene](/img/extensions/Editor/MaterialsBuilder/ApplyOnScene.png)

Then, select a mesh in your scene and set the material you created :)

# Known limitations

* Once the material is built, only 2D textures preview are supported in "**Samplers**" menu, in edition tool
