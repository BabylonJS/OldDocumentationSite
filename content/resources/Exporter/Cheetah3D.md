## Cheetah2Babylon

[Cheetah 3D](http://www.cheetah3d.com/) exporter for [Babylon.JS](https://babylonjs.com/) .babylon scene files. Currently supports the following :

- mesh export with functional transform, naming and parenting
- multicamera export (only perspective, no support for orthogonal right now)
- light export with all babylon type managed :
  - Cheetah3D spot light is a babylon spot (duh)
  - Cheetah3D distant light is a babylon directional light
  - Cheetah3D ambiant light is a babylon hemispheric light
  - every other type is a babylon point light
  - supports diffuse and specular color
  - rotations must be on the -Y axis

- materials export:
  - supports diffuse, emissive and specular color (plus specular power as "shininess")
  - supports only diffuse textures, Cheetah3D api is realy sparse on that
