## Introduction

Babylon.js v3.1 introduced a new component based tools: the behaviors.
A behavior is a simple class that can be attached to a node where it will provide a specific set of features. Features will be triggered by defined events. 

## General

A behavior is defined by the following interface:
* `name`: Return the name of the behavior
* `attach(node)`: This function will be called when a behavior is attached to a node. This is where the behavior will hook into useful events
* `detach()`: This function will be called when a behavior is detached from the previously attached node. The behavior must clear any associated resources and unhook all events

If behaviors rely on animation, the following **static** properties will be available:
* `EasingFunction`: Define the easing function used animations
* `EasingMode`: Define the easing mode used by animations

You can add behaviors to node objects (lights, cameras and meshes). Every node provides the following entry points:
* `addBehavior(behavior)`: Use this function to attach a behavior to a given node
* `removeBehavior(behavior)`: Use this function to detach a behavior from a node
* `getBehaviorByName(name)`: Return a behavior with the given name or null if not found
* `behaviors`: This read-only property returns the list of behaviors associated with the node

Most of the time, behaviors are designed to deal with a specific kind of nodes. 
Let's have a look at the list of behaviors available in babylon.js core.

## Camera behaviors

### Bouncing behavior
The bouncing behavior (`BABYLON.BouncingBehavior`) is designed to produce a small bouncing effect when an **ArcRotateCamera** reaches the lowerRadiusLimit or the upperRadiusLimit.

The bouncing behavior can be configured using the following properties:
* `transitionDuration`: Define the duration of the animation, in milliseconds. By default the value is set to 450ms
* `lowerRadiusTransitionRange`: Define the length of the distance animated by the transition when lower radius is reached. By default the value is set to 2
* `upperRadiusTransitionRange`: Define the length of the distance animated by the transition when upper radius is reached. By default the value is set to -2
* `autoTransitionRange`: Define a value indicating if the lowerRadiusTransitionRange and upperRadiusTransitionRange are defined automatically. Transition ranges will be set to 5% of the bounding box diagonal in world space

You can easily turn on this behavior on an ArcRotateCamera with the following code:

```
camera.useBouncingBehavior = true;
```

Once created you can get a direct access to the behavior with `camera.bouncingBehavior`.

###  AutoRotation behavior
The autoRotation behavior (`BABYLON.AutoRotationBehavior`) is designed to create a smooth rotation of an **ArcRotateCamera** when there is no user interaction.

This behavior can be configured with the following properties:
* `idleRotationSpeed`: Speed at which the camera rotates around the mesh
* `idleRotationWaitTime`: Time (in milliseconds) to wait after user interaction before the camera starts rotating
* `idleRotationSpinupTime`: Time (milliseconds) to take to spin up to the full idle rotation speed
* `zoomStopsAnimation`: Flag that indicates if user zooming should stop animation
* `rotationInProgress`: Gets a value indicating if the camera is currently rotating because of this behavior

You can easily turn on this behavior on an ArcRotateCamera with the following code:

```
camera.useAutoRotationBehavior = true;
```

Once created you can get a direct access to the behavior with `camera.autoRotationBehavior`.

###  FramingBehavior behavior
The framing behavior (`BABYLON.FramingBehavior`) is designed to automatically position an **ArcRotateCamera** when its target is set to a mesh.
It is also useful if you want to prevent the camera to go under a virtual horizontal plane.

This behavior can be configured with the following properties:
* `mode`: The behavior can be configured to:
 * `BABYLON.FramingBehavior.IgnoreBoundsSizeMode`: The camera can move all the way towards the mesh
 * `BABYLON.FramingBehavior.FitFrustumSidesMode`: The camera is not allowed to zoom closer to the mesh than the point at which the adjusted bounding sphere touches the frustum sides. This is the default mode.
* `radiusScale`: Define the scale applied to the radius (1 by default)
* `positionScale`: the scale to apply on Y axis to position camera focus. 0.5 by default which means the center of the bounding box
* `defaultElevation`: Define the angle above/below the horizontal plane to return to when the return to default elevation idle behaviour is triggered, in radians (0.3 by default)
* `elevationReturnTime`: Define the time (in milliseconds) taken to return to the default beta position (1500 by default). Negative value indicates camera should not return to default
* `elevationReturnWaitTime`: Define the delay (in milliseconds) taken before the camera returns to the default beta position (1000 by default)
* `zoomStopsAnimation`: Define if user zooming should stop animation
* `framingTime`: Define the transition time when framing the mesh, in milliseconds (1500 by default)
* `isUserIsMoving`: Gets a value indicating if the user is moving the camera

You can easily turn on this behavior on an ArcRotateCamera with the following code:

```
camera.useFramingBehavior = true;
```

Once created you can get a direct access to the behavior with `camera.framingBehavior`.
