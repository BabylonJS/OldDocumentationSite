# Quick Tree Generator

![Generated Tree ](/img/extensions/trees/quick1.png)

The function QuickTreeGenerator uses a sphere with randomized vertices to generate a tree. 

It is based on Julian Temechon's tutorial on the VertexData object http://www.pixelcodr.com/tutos/trees/trees.html

A demo can be found at:  https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#LG3GS#107

call the function

```
var tree = QuickTreeGenerator(sizeBranch, sizeTrunk, radius, trunkMaterial, leafMaterial, scene);
```

## Parameters

sizeBranch - sphere radius used for branches and leaves 15 to 20.

sizeTrunk - height of trunk 10 to 15.

radius - radius of trunk 1 to 5.
