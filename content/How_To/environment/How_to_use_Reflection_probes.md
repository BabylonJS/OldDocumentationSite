# How to use Reflection probes
![Reflection Probes example](/img/reflectionProbe.jpg)

Reflection probes are used to dynamically generate cube maps that can the be used as reflection textures for instance.

Here is how to use them:

```
var probe = new BABYLON.ReflectionProbe("main", 512, scene);
probe.renderList.push(yellowSphere);
probe.renderList.push(greenSphere);	
probe.renderList.push(blueSphere);	
probe.renderList.push(mirror);	

mainMaterial.reflectionTexture = probe.cubeTexture;
```

As you can see, you have to define which meshes will be rendered by the reflection probe.

**You have to be cautious with reflection probes as they need to actually generate 6 textures per frame (One per face).**

You can change the update rate (on every frame by default) with this code:

```
probe.refreshRate = BABYLON.RenderTargetTexture.REFRESHRATE_RENDER_ONCE;	
// or
probe.refreshRate = BABYLON.RenderTargetTexture.REFRESHRATE_RENDER_ONEVERYFRAME;	
// or
probe.refreshRate = BABYLON.RenderTargetTexture.REFRESHRATE_RENDER_ONEVERYTWOFRAMES;
// or
probe.refreshRate = 3;
```

To get the best possible rendering, you also need to move your probe at the center of the mesh which should use the generated cube map.
(Internally the probe will generate a ghost camera at the specific position and will then render the faces from there). You have two options to achieve this:

```
probe.attachToMesh(root);
// or
probe.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0);
```
