# How To Apply Bumps, Opacity and Tiling
A range of effects can be achieved with textures using a few extra lines of code.

## Bump Map
Bump mapping is a technique to simulate bump and dents on a rendered surface. These are made by creating a **normal map** from an image. 
The means to do this can be found on the web, a search for 'normal map generator' will bring up free and paid for methods of doing this.

A bump map can be used with a color; with its original image or another image as below.

### Creating a Bump Map Example
Just add a _bumpTexture_ to any existing textures.

```javascript
var myMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("myMaterial", scene);
myMaterial.bumpTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("PATH TO NORMAL MAP", scene);
```

### Inverting Bumps and Dents
Use _invertNormalMapX_ and/or _invertNormalMapY_ on the material.

```javascript
var myMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("myMaterial", scene);
myMaterial.bumpTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("PATH TO NORMAL MAP", scene);
myMaterial.invertNormalMapX = true;
myMaterial.invertNormalMapY = true
```

## Opacity
The opacity of a material can be graded using an image with varying tranparency. The following PNG image with 
a transparency gradient can be applied to a material using _opacityTexture_

with the same gradient applied to the material as in the image below.

### Applying Opacity
Add an _opacityTexture_ to any existing texture.
```javascript
var myMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("myMaterial", scene);
myMaterial.opacityTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("PATH TO NORMAL MAP", scene);
```

## Tiling
When a material is applied to a mesh the image used for a texture is positioned according to coordinates. 
Rather than x, y which are already in use for the 3D axes the letters u and v are used for the coordinates.

![uv axes](/img/how_to/Materials/crate.png)

To tile an image you use the _uScale_ and/or _vScale_ properties, of the texture, to set the number of tiles in each direction.

```javascript
myMaterial.diffuseTexture.uScale = 5.0;
myMaterial.diffuseTexture.vScale = 5.0;
```
## Offsetting
To offset your texture on your mesh, you  use the _uOffset_ and _vOffset_ properties, of the texture, to set the offset in each direction.

```javascript
myMaterial.diffuseTexture.uOffset = 1.5;
myMaterial.diffuseTexture.vOffset = 0.5;
```
